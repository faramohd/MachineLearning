 Objective
Develop a classification model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in an imbalanced dataset using oversampling techniques.
Methods employed to deal with class imbalance: 
- Oversample minority class
- Undersample majority class
- SMOTE - Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique
Classification model used : Logistic Regression

This project simulates real-world fraud detection workflows where precision and recall trade-offs are critical.

Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection]
- Records: 284,807 transactions
- Class distribution: 492 fraud cases (~0.17%) vs 284,315 non-fraud
- Features: PCA-transformed columns (V1 to V28), `Time`, `Amount`, and `Class` (target)

 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

 Workflow
1. Data Exploration
   - Check for class imbalance
   - Visualize distributions

2. Preprocessing
   - Feature scaling
   - Train-test split

3. Handling Imbalance
    
   - Applied `SMOTE` to oversample the minority class (fraud cases)

4. Modeling
   - Logistic Regression
   - Evaluated using:
     - Confusion Matrix
     - Precision, Recall, F1-score
